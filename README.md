# 🚁 DroneZY — Python Drone Control Meets MacOS Absurdity
DroneZY is a Python-based drone control interface wrapped into a native macOS .app—designed for creators who think flying machines deserve playful UIs and eerie hover sounds.

Whether you're commanding a lone Tello in your garage or dreaming up swarm choreography in your living room, DroneZY lets you:

✈️ Send real-time flight commands with djitellopy

🎥 Stream video directly to your Mac

🧠 Build absurd flight patterns like "crop circle spiral" or "hover tantrum"

🔊 Integrate surreal sound effects that react to altitude, battery, and mood

Packaged with py2app, DroneZY lets you distribute your drone chaos as a self-contained .app. No Xcode. No App Store. Just Python-powered weirdness on macOS.
